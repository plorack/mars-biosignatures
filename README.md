# Abstract

This repository contains an analysis aiming to achieve a statistical exploration of the VIS/NIR data obtained by the M3 hyperspectral imager onboarded on the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft (Lunar Orbiter launched on the 22 October 2008 ).

In particular:
- The analyis is focused on on Mare Imbrium for which data quality is the best (good sunlight phase angle and optimal temperature of the instrument ensured better recording of incoming photons). 
- The analysis uses data collected by the instrument while in global mode hence generating spectral information spanning 85 spectral bands.
 
The goal of the statistical analysis is to find mineralogical comonalities and/or differences among different volcanic units that constitutes Mare Ibrium as presented in F. Thiessen, S. Besse et al, 2014, Mapping lunar mare basalt units in mare Imbrium as observed with the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), Planetary and Space Science 104 (2014) 244â€“252.
